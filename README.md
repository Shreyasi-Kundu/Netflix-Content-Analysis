Welcome to the repository for my Netflix Power BI project, where I analyzed Netflix's vast content library to uncover trends in content quality, viewer engagement, and global preferences using interactive data visualizations.

📊 Project Overview
This Power BI report answers compelling questions like:
Do TV Shows outperform Movies in quality?
Which countries produce the most and highest-rated content?
What genres dominate audience engagement and ratings?
Which titles have received extreme praise—or criticism?
The dashboard is a visual journey through genres, release years, countries, and user ratings—designed to give both entertainment fans and data enthusiasts valuable insights at a glance.
